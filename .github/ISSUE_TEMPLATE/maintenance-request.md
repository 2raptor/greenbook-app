Discuss the feature with the #product channel in our slack before creating the issue https://join.slack.com/share/zt-jdggpg0w-2oxQotnStBJ59xDPMXGz~g

Create a “Maintenance” issue when there is a technical need to make any updates/changes to the code base. 

Examples:
    • Routine maintenance to servers/services/infrastructure
    • Upgrading packages
    • Moving to a new web-hosting party
    • Running manual cron-jobs on a server
    • Backup and restore jobs that require human involvement***
